test-resources
---------
Test-time related configuration files (*.properties, *.xml) and other resources reside in this directory.  These files are copied into the test classpath, they are not included in the project distribution unit.

You may remove this file once you understand the project structure and the purpose of this directory: this file also serves as a "empty directory" placeholder so CVS won't prune the directory.
