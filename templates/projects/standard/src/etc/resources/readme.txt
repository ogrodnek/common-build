resources
---------
Project configuration files (*.properties, *.xml, etc.) and other resources (images, help, etc.) exist in this directory.

You may remove this file once you understand the project structure and the purpose of this directory: this file also serves as a "empty directory" placeholder so CVS won't prune the directory.
