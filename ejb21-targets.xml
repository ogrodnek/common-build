 This ant XML fragment is meant to be imported into a project build file, along with
 common-targets.xml, in order to provide build handling for EJB 2.1 format EJBs. This
 is an optional module, and due to the way the ant import works, there is no way to
 automatically hook this up into the build. The importing project must override
 appropropriate 'hook' targets from common-targets.xml, and then have the override 
 targets depend on both the targets from common-targets and those from here.

 TODO: this is currently not finished. It is in the process of being re-organized due
 to use of Ivy.
